# InventoryFilter [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/cooper-anderson-mc/InventoryFilter.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/cooper-anderson-mc/InventoryFilter)
InventoryFilter is a mod for Minecraft `1.12.2+`. It enables you to whitelist or blacklist your inventory to only allow certain items in.

In the config screen of the mod you can:
 * quickly enable/disable the mod
 * switch if the filter is a whitelist or blacklist
 * set which gamemodes the filter applies to
 * and most importantly, change the filtered item list

The filter also allows for [Regular Expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), so you can filter items to your heart's content.

## Reguirements
 * Minecraft with Forge version `14.23.4.2713` or higher

## Installation
 * It is recommended to install via the [Twitch Desktop App](https://app.twitch.tv/download)'s Minecraft mod manager
 * If for some reason you must install it manually, just drop the .jar file in the mods folder in your minecraft directory as usual
